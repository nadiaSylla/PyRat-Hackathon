# PyRat-Hackathon
Worked during this Hackathon with my partner Maya Rahal.

The goal was to develop algorithm utilizing meta-heuristic graph models to formulate an optimized strategy for guiding a rat through a maze. Each pair played against another pair, and the team whose algorithm allowed their Rat to accumulate more positive points than the rat of the opposing team won.
